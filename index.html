<h1>Computational Thinking</h1>
<h2>University of Verona, A.Y. 2022/23</h2>

<h3>Learning objectives</h3>
In this course students will be introduced to computational thinking, the process of approaching, analysing, formulating, and solving a problem in such a way that the solution can be performed by a computer. At the end of the course students: will learn the historical and theoretical background of computational thinking; will know the principles at the core of computational problem solving; will be able to understand the capabilities of computers, to formulate problems to be addressed by a computer, and to design algorithms that a computer can execute.

<h3>Prerequisites and basic notions</h3>

<h3>Didactic methods</h3>
Teaching modality will involve frontal lessons and practical activities (to be carried out via online tools). Students will also be invited to participate in seminar-like activities.

<h3>Learning assessment procedures</h3>
The exam will be divided into two parts. For attending students, the first part of the exam will consist in the evaluation of in-class interaction (participation in practical activities and seminar discussions). The second part will consist in the redaction of a short report concerning one of the course topics. The report will have to be submitted in advance and will be discussed during the exam. For non-attending students, the first part will be replaced by an interrogation on the course topics.
<br/>
Students with disabilities or specific learning disorders (SLD), who intend to request the adaptation of the exam, must follow the instructions given <a href="https://www.univr.it/en/our-services/-/servizi/inclusion-and-accessibility-support-for-students-with-disabilities-and-specific-learning-disorder-sld-learning-disabilities/taking-exams-under-special-conditions-">HERE</a>

<h3>Evaluation criteria</h3>
Students should demonstrate that they have learned the basics of computational thinking, being able to apply and adapt it to concrete problems. At the same time, they should have acquired a critical and balanced assessment of its potential and limitations.

<h3>Exam language</h3>
English
